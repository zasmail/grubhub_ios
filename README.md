## Storyboard
![Storyboard](RiderClient/Resources/Assets.xcassets/Main_storyboard_—_Edited.png)

## Notes
- MVP for demonstation purposes
- Relies on [this backend](https://github.com/zasmail/grubhub_backend) which is currently hosted on Heroku
- Relies on Algolia to render orders
- Backend fakes a delivery and uses Pusher to update the delivery driver's location
- The chat is faked and can be seen live [here](https://mysterious-woodland-40384.herokuapp.com/) with [this repo for the react frontend](https://github.com/zasmail/grubhub_chat) and [this for the node backend](https://github.com/zasmail/grubhub_chat_server)
